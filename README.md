# Date Recognition in Historical Parish Records

This repository contains a dataset of birthdates from Danish parish records. It is described in our corresponding ICFHR 2022 paper titled [*Date Recognition in Historical Parish Records*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21648-0_4).

## Repository Structure
We provide a dataset of segmented birthdates under [data/birthdate](data/birthdate) and a dataset of segmented row IDs under [data/row_id](data/row_id). Each dataset is split into train, validation, and test folders. The test folder is further split into easy, average, and difficult folders, as described in our paper. Each folder contains images and a `labels.csv` file that maps from filenames to labels.
